# Tip-Calculator

A Tip Calculator Application coded using `Javascript, HTML, CSS` is a simple web application that helps users calculate the appropriate tip amount to add to their bill at a restaurant or any other service where tipping is customary. The application provides a user-friendly interface where the user can input the total bill amount, select a desired tip percentage, and optionally split the bill among a specified number of people. The application then calculates and displays the total amount to be paid, including the tip, along with the individual amounts for each person if the bill is being split.
